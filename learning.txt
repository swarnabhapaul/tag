how to use it and why we use it

code review process
    - Give a good description to understand what you done.
    - Is code understandable ?
    - Is there any duplicate code ?
    - Is the function too big ? If yes, is the function or class having too many responsibilities?
    - misspelled variable
    - parameters passed in the wrong order or unused parameters
    - use snake_case vs camelCase vs PascalCase



Architecture
    The code should follow the defined architecture.

        Separation of Concerns followed
            Split into multiple layers and tiers as per requirements (Presentation, Business and Data layers).
            Split into respective files (HTML, JavaScript and CSS).
        Code is in sync with existing code patterns/technologies.
        Design patterns: Use appropriate design pattern (if it helps), after completely understanding the problem and context.


microfrontend: Microfrontends are especially useful when we have projects with dozens of developers working together in a large business domain and want to reduce complexity by splitting into multiple subdomains, independently deploying different parts of applications without overloading communication and coordination between teams.

qa test in frontend 

architecture of the web application
    Monolithic (Single Codebase)
    Microservices
        Advantages: Isolation, Scalability, Flexibility, Simplified Development
    Serverless 
        Advantages: Dont care about server, Pay for used server spaced , tech support.
